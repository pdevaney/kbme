This files describes API changes in the editor_atto code.

=== 2.9 ===

* When adding a shortcut to the button of a plugin, atto will add a layer of validation
to ensure that only the required keys are pressed. However, if you are using a custom
keyConfig object you must validate the shortcut yourself. This is particularly important
for non-English keyboard users. For more information read the documentation of
EditorPluginButtons::_addKeyboardListener() and MDL-47133.

=== 2.9.19 ===

* New methods added to notify module for finer control of hiding an Atto message.
* New methods added to notify module for display of a new type of message: alert.
* Autosave module also now fires some more events for improved control over messaging display.
